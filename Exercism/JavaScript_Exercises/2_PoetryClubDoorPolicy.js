// A quick reminder about exercise stubs:
//
// üí° You're allowed to completely clear any stub before you get started. Often

// work with the tests, which you can find in ./door-policy.spec.js.

// üí° You don't need to write JSDoc comment blocks yourself; it is not expected
// in idiomatic JavaScript, but some companies and style-guides do enforce them.
//
// Good luck with that door policy!
