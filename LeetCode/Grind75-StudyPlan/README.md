# Grind 75 - 15 Week Coding Interview Prep

This repository tracks my progress through the **Grind 75** study plan by [Tech Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75), built by the author of Blind 75. The goal is to master essential coding problems for technical interviews by solving **169 curated LeetCode problems** across 15 weeks, dedicating **10 hours per week**.


This repository documents my journey through the [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75) study plan, a curated list of 169 LeetCode problems designed to prepare for coding interviews. I'm aiming to complete the plan over 15 weeks with a consistent focus of around 10 hours per week.

## ðŸ›  How to Use This Repo

1. Create a folder per week: `week01`, `week02`, ..., `week15`.
2. Inside each week, save your solutions as `<problem-name>.js` (or `.py`, `.ts`, etc.).
3. Update this README with progress checkmarks and notes.
4. Use markdown files or comments in code to note key learnings or patterns.

## ðŸ§­ Why This Plan?

The Grind 75 plan is balanced, structured, and intentionally minimal. It covers high-frequency interview questions with a focus on understanding patterns, not just brute memorization.
