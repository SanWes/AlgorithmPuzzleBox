https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/

Pseudocode & Thinking Process:
Step 1: Initialize an output array
We'll collect intervals into this as we go.

Step 2: Iterate through existing intervals
Weâ€™ll go through 3 possible cases for each interval:

    Current interval ends before newInterval starts
        âž¤ Just add it to the result â€” no overlap yet.

    Current interval starts after newInterval ends
        âž¤ Weâ€™ve passed the merging range, so:

    Add the newInterval to result (once),

    Then add the rest of the intervals as-is.

    Intervals overlap with newInterval
        âž¤ Merge them:

        newInterval[0] = min(current start, newInterval[0])

        newInterval[1] = max(current end, newInterval[1])

Step 3: Edge Case
What if we never inserted newInterval?
âž¤ Add it to the end after the loop (e.g., when newInterval comes after all intervals).

/* 
    Psuedo Code 
- intervals[i] = [starti, endi] -> start = index [0] , end = index[1]
- two arrays of intervals in ascending order
- insert the second array into the first 
- ensure intervals1 is still sorted and no overlapping intervals
- return intervals1 after insertion

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]

/*
Same problem with understandable variable names for a calendar assistant scheduling meetings


Pseudo Code 

looped through each interval and split logic into three clear cases:

1. No overlap (before new starts)

2. No overlap (after new ends)

3. Overlap â€” we merge by updating start and end bounds.

This lets me preserve sorting and eliminate overlap, all in one pass.

This solution runs in linear time O(n) and uses O(n) space, since we only scan through the interval list once and collect results in a new array without doing any nested operations or sorting.
